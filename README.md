My goal for this project is controlling mouse clicks, cursor and other functions like alt-tab,closing windows, take screenshot and more, i used my own dataset in roboflow you can check dataset at https://app.roboflow.com/project1-x0qkb/nesne_tespit_projesi/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true
I shared MediaPipe Hands model with basic codes and moves, its include just a mediapipe model
Other codes have Yolo and MediaPipe models together, if you want to use face detection you can check codes.
